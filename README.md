# News Summary challenge

## Project overview

Your app will grab all the headlines from the Guardian newspaper API and display them on a page.  Clicking on a headline will show a summary of the article.

### Technologies

- JavaScript
- CSS
- HTML
- test framework

### Serving your app

You'll use a static web server (e.g. [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)) to serve your HTML, CSS and JavaScript files.  You'll send requests to an API to get data from the Guardian and to summarise text.
